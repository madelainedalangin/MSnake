# MSnake
a simple snake game similar to the 5110 Nokias and the other Nokia phones in the late 90s and early 00s when they became popular. However, the user uses trackpad and wipe + clicks to the direction they wish the snake to travel. The snake increases in length as it eats the food, and the travel speed also increases.
